## About OOP(object oriented programing)

This program will explain how object oriented programming will work.


## Object Oriented Programming Concept

Class
Object
Data Abstraction and Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polyorphism

I have tried to cover all the object oriented proramming concept in this programs.

## Interface and Abstract class

I have tried to cover most difficult concept of oops like interface and abstract class with all permutation and combination.

## Polymorphism

I have covered both compile time and runtime polmorphism. 

## Compile time polymorphism

Compile time polymorphism includes method overloading and method overriding.

## Run time polymorphism

It includes virtual function and virtual base class and pure virtual function.Since php does not support polymorphism even though i tried to give demo of both type of polymorphism. 

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a concept of reuse code.Since i have covered all polymorphism and data abstraction and encasulation and interface and abstract class so interface is automatically covers.

## Trait

I have also cover trait which enables you to reuse several methods freely in class in deferent class hierarchy.
